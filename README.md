# Vilma

Statistical and financial clojure. 


## Usage

### Finance package
This package is used for standard financial calculation. Designed to take named arguments.
Throws a RuntimeException if the information is not sufficient.

```clojure
(ns vilma.finance-test
  (:require [vilma.finance :as fin])

;; Calculating present value

;; Simple present value of a future value
(fin/present-value :future-value 100 :n 10 :discount-rate 5)
;; => 61.39

;; Present value of a cash flow
(fin/present-value :cashflow [100 100 -10 100] :discount-rate 10)
;; => 234.34

;; Present value of non-growing perpetuity
(present-value :payment 10 :discount-rate 10)
;; => 1000.00

;; Present value of growing perpetuity
(present-value :payment 10 :discount-rate 10 :growth-rate 5)
;; => 500.00

;; Calculating future value
(fin/future-value :present-value 100 :n 10 :interest-rate 5)
;; => 162.89

```
You can't input just anything (even though it seems like it).
There are very specific combination of inputs that work. (And more to come)
```clojure
;; Possible inputmaps for present value
{:future-value :n :discount-rate}
;; or
{:cashflow :discount-rate}

;; Possible inputmaps for present value
{:present-value :n :interest-rate}
```
